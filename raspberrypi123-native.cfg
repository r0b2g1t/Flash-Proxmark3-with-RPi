# raspberrypi123-native.cfg (now for all of the Raspis)
# ItÂ´s about 4 times faster for writing and 14 times faster for reading
# compared to the generic sysfsgpio driver

# Config for using Raspberry Pi's expansion header
#
# This is best used with a fast enough buffer but also
# is suitable for direct connection if the target voltage
# matches RPi's 3.3V and the cable is short enough.
#
# Do not forget the GND connection, pin 6 of the expansion header.
#
# Please set the right peripheral_base address and Transition delay
# depending on which Raspi (1,2 or 3) you use.
